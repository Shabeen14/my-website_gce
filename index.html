              <P>Ghousia College of Engineering, established in 1980, is a Minority College in Karnataka. It is affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University and is recognized by AICTE, New Delhi and the Government of Karnataka. 
              All departments at Ghousia College of Engineering are accredited by NBA for the third consecutive term. Also, the college has been awarded as Excellent College for Engineering in Karnataka, recently.
              The college offers admissions in 6 specializations of B.E. and 4 specializations of M.Tech. The admissions are based upon state counseling and also upon merit. 
              Ghousia Industrial Training Center, (GITC)
             The trust started the Ghousia I.T. in the same year to train craftsman in trades of Fitter, Draughtsman mechanical, according to the Industrial training institutes set up by the Government of India. In the year 1977, the institute got its recognition and affiliation to the National Council for Vocational Training (NCVT), Government of India. New trades like refrigeration & air conditioning mechanic, mechanic radio & television (which was subsequently converted to electronics mechanic) & electrician were introduced and the institution has now become the most sought after amongst the Industrial Training Institutes. Many public and private sector industries depute their employees for apprentice training and regular campus interviews are held for selection of skilled personnel. The trust has provided an excellent secured atmosphere in the campus located on a sprawling 3 acres land with spacious classrooms, well-equipped workshops, laboratories and computer lab etc.

        <img src="cse.jpg" alt="" style="height: 200px;">
        <p> <h3> Science Engineering (CSE) encompasses a variety of topics that relates to computation,
          like analysis of algorithms, programming languages, program design, software, and computer hardware.
          Computer Science engineering has roots in electrical engineering, mathematics, and linguistics.
          In the past Computer Science was taught as part of mathematics or engineering departments & in the recent days it has emerged as a separate engineering field.
          VISION:- To provide state of art teaching,learning in software and hardware programmers to the students 
          to enable them to become world-class computer science and engineering graduates to face global compition
          MISSION:-To be one of the best computer science and engineering departments in the entire nation
          producing world-class engoneers processing excellent knowledge, skills, charecteristics and other attibutes.</h3>

        <img src="ece.jpg"alt="">
        <p><h3>Electronic engineering (also called electronics and communications engineering) is an electrical engineering discipline which utilizes 
               nonlinear and active electrical components (such as semiconductor devices, especially transistors and diodes) to design electronic circuits, devices, integrated circuits and their systems.
               The discipline typically also designs passive electrical components, usually based on printed circuit boards.
               Electronics is a subfield within the wider electrical engineering academic subject but denotes a broad engineering field that covers subfields such as 
               analog electronics, digital electronics, consumer electronics, embedded systems and power electronics. Electronics engineering deals with implementation of applications, 
               principles and algorithms developed within many related fields, for example solid-state physics, radio engineering, telecommunications, control systems, signal processing, 
               systems engineering, computer engineering, instrumentation engineering, electric power control, robotics, and many others.</h3>

        <img src="eee.jpg"alt="">
        <p><h3> Electrical engineering is an engineering discipline concerned with the study, design and application of equipment, devices and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism. It emerged as an identifiable occupation in the latter half of the 19th century after commercialization of the electric telegraph, the telephone, and electrical power generation, distribution and use.
         Electrical engineering is now divided into a wide range of different fields, including computer engineering, systems engineering, power engineering, telecommunications, radio-frequency engineering, signal processing, instrumentation, photovoltaic cells, electronics, and optics and photonics. Many of these disciplines overlap with other engineering branches, spanning a huge number of specializations including hardware engineering, power electronics, electromagnetics and waves, microwave engineering, nanotechnology, electrochemistry, renewable energies, mechatronics/control, and electrical materials science.[a]
        Electrical engineers typically hold a degree in electrical engineering or electronic engineering.</h3>

      <p><h3>Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment, including public works such as roads, bridges, canals, dams, airports, sewage systems, pipelines, structural components of buildings, and railways.[1][2]
           Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines. It is considered the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering,[3] and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering.[4] Civil engineering can take place in the public sector from municipal public works departments through to federal government agencies, and in the private sector from locally based firms to global Fortune 500 companies.</h3>

        <p><h3>> Mechanical engineering is an engineering branch that combines engineering physics and mathematics principles with materials science to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems.[1] It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering branches.
         The mechanical engineering field requires an understanding of core areas including mechanics, dynamics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity. In addition to these core principles, mechanical engineers use tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), and product lifecycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, watercraft, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others. It is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery.[2][3]</h3>
